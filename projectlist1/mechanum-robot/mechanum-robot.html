				<h1>Overview</h1><hr>
                <p>
					The purpose of this page is to document the decisions made behind this mechanum robot. 
					The robot took me roughly 6 months to develop, but after a long break from the project,
					it took me another 2-4 months to get where it is now. I ended up completely recoding 
					the entire thing because I was unhappy with the overall hastily put together code. I 
					also wanted more functionality which my current code would not be able to support without 
					a rewrite.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To make it easier to understand, I will be separating the electronic, mechanical, and 
					software designs. If a section uses information from another, I will link it before 
					going into detail about that section. Onwards!

                <h1>Mechanical Design</h1><hr>
                <p>
					When I was first idealizing this robot, the first goal was that I wanted it to be 
					compact. Thinking back on this decision, this was not a good idea and if I were to 
					redo the project, I would give my self more space on the robot. Most of the 
					problems have been either fixed or I had to make a comprimise, but this is all 
					apart of the design process, so its nothing new.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Developing in CADD</h2>
				<p>
					Before jumping into buying pieces for the robot, I ended up designing 
					a moc-up in CADD. In doing so I was able to figure out most of the spacing and find 
					out where I need holes for mounting brackets etc. I will use the CADD in some cases 
					to show pictures of the design of the robot that I would otherwise not be able to 
					with the physical thing.
				</p>

				<p>
					Due to the compact nature of the 
					robot, even with CADD, I still had problems with some things not working how I 
					wanted them to and it also left me no room for expansion.
				</p>

				<p>
					Some of the problems that I ran into because of the compact size were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Overall placement of driverboards <small>(The boards between the stepper motors)</small></li>
					<li>Size of the stepper motors</li>
					<li>Battery size and capacity</li>
					<li>I/O ease of access</li>
					<li>Room for cooling fans</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Main Layout</h2>
				<p>
					The main layout of the robot consists of an 1/8th inch (3.175 mm) solid aluminium, 
					cnc cut, plate. This plate has mounting holes for standoffs and brackets. There 
					are 4 steppers motors, with mechanum wheels attached to their D shaped shafts with a 
					key. There is one stepper on each corner facing outwards. These steppers are mounted 
					using steel brackets that are bolted down to the bottom plate. Between these steppers 
					are a custom built driver board which handels all the coil driving for the steppers 
					it is between. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The driver boards are held in place using a 3D Printed bracket the 
					is mounted to the stepper brackets. Right in the middle of the robot is where the 
					power distribution and logic handeling is done. The battery and 12V-5V DC-DC 
					Converter are placed directly on the plate. Above the bottom plate is another 
					aluminium plate called the top plate, that is of the same thickness of the bottom 
					plate. This plate is held up using brass standoffs. On that holds the "brains" 
					<small>(Raspberry Pi 3b+ w/ a Arduino Leonardo Sheild)</small>.
				</p>

				<h2>Nuts and Bolts</h2>
				<p>
					One of the main issues when using stepper motors is the vibration that they can 
					generate when in use. The vibration is at its worst when it is at something 
					called its "resonant frequency" or "resonance". All stepper motors have resonance, 
					and you can measure how much osillation you are having by coupaling a DC Motor 
					Shaft with your Stepper motor shaft and connecting the DC Motor output to an 
					osiclloscope. There are also mathmatical ways to figure out the resonant frequency 
					but that is out side the scope of this documentation. I will link more articles on 
					this topic in the <a>Further Readings</a> section 
				</p>

				<p>
					You can counter act this a few ways. One way is by stepping a stepper slower or 
					faster depeneding on where the resonance is located. Most of the time resonance 
					only happens at a few different frequencys then goes away at high or lower drive 
					frequencies. This can be shown here:
				</p>

				<img class="s1" alt="sample-image" src="images/ramp.png">
				<h5 class="source"> Source: http://www.euclidres.com/apps/stepper_motor/stepper.html</h5>

				<p>
					Or by using something called 
					microsteping. Microstepping is explained later on in <a>Electronic Design</a>. Not only this 
					but due to how the mechanum wheels are shaped, it is not always a smooth ride.
				</p>

				<p>
					The problem with the vibration is that the nuts and bolts that are holding on 
					to the wheels, keeping the steppers in place, and basically holding the whole 
					robot together; can worm their way loose and even come off entirely. There are 
					multiple ways to fix this such as locktite or just tightening the nuts every 
					time you use the robot. Even then, these are not permenant and require upkeep. 
					There is another solution that keep everything together without as much upkeep. 
					They are called nylon lock nuts.
				</p>
				<img class="s1" alt="sample-image" src="images/Nylon-lock.jpg">
				<h5 class="source">Source: No longer available E-Bay listing</h5>

                <p>
					Nylon lock nuts are perfect for this problem. When threaded onto a bolt, the 
					nylon on the end of the nut holds onto the threads of the nut tightly, keeping 
					it from coming off. There is obviously more science behind it then just my 
					explanation.
				</p>

				<h2>The Mechanum Wheels</h2>

				<img class="s1" alt="sample-image" src="images/wheel.png">
				<h5 class="source">Source: me :)</h5>
				
				<p>
					The mechanum wheel is one of the key parts of this entire robot. It is the 
					main reason I wanted to make this robot. When I first started this project, I 
					knew I wanted to use these wheels, but I did not know how hard it was going to be 
					to program them CORRECTLY. How to drive these wheels correctly requires using 
					a kinematics algorithm that spits out the wheel speed calculations easily. I 
					will go into more detail about how to program a mechanum drive train in the 
					<a>Software Design</a> section.
				</p>

				<p>
					The key feature of Mechanum wheels is that a full drivetrain can translate
					<small>(Moving around without turning)</small>. A normal RC drivetrain usually 
					has the front two wheels turn and the back two wheels drive, just like a car. 
					A mechanum drivetrain can slide in almost any direction without turning the chassis 
					of the robot. The way it does this is by taking advantage of angled rollers where 
					a normal wheelbase would be.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Mechanum wheels have to be setup a certain way for translation to work. For a proper 
					mechanum drivetrain, all wheels need to have their rollers pointing towards 
					the center of the robot like so:
				</p>

				<img class="s1" alt="sample-image" src="images/p1010075-zoom_LI.jpg">
				<h5 class="source">Source: me :)</h5>

                <p>
					The next step after pointing the wheels in their right orientation is to actually drive the steppers that are connected to the wheels.
